## Overview

There is growing interest in developing a simple, intuitive air quality index that simultaneously accounts for the health effects of multiple air pollutants [@dominici2010protecting; @stieb2008new; @bopp2018something]. Health effects of air pollution depend on the composition of pollutants in the air, not simply the levels of a single pollutant [@dominici2010protecting]. An air quality index that reflects this understanding should account for the levels and relative contributions of each air pollutant in the ambient air. In this proposal, we will improve statistical methods for conducting inference on the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple environmental pollutants, with a focus on quantifying short-term effects of poor air quality on health outcomes at the population level.

The *constrained groupwise additive index model* (cGAIM), introduced by @hardle1993 [see also @xia2006cumulative], is a vehicle for providing a multi-pollutant health index. Writing $\lambda_{it}$ for the risk of a particular outcome for an individual $i$ on day $t$,  the cGAIM is
$$
  \lambda_{it} = \exp\left[ X_{it}^{T}\beta + s(\alpha^{T} Z_{it} ) + f_{1}( W_{1it} ) + \ldots + f_{K}( W_{Kit} ) \right].
$$
The $\beta$ parameters are the fixed effects of the potentially time-varying linear covariates $X_{it}$, and $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{K}$ are smooth functions that account for potential confounding variables $W_{kit}$ ($k = 1 \ldots K$). The distinguishing feature of cGAIM is the smooth function $s$ whose argument is a linear combination of covariates $Z_t$, which might be PM 2.5 and Ozone. The $\alpha$ parameter is a vector of weights on the entries of $Z_t$, and gives their relative contributions.   The smooth functions $s$ and the $f_k$ might be composed of spline functions or Gaussian processes such as random walks.  

While cGaim has until now been used with daily case counts as the response variable, we will employ case crossover models, which have seen increased attention in the air pollution literature [@wei2019short; @stringer2020approximate].  These models define one or more *control days* for each case, for example the same day of the week on the previous two weeks, and use a partial likelihood for the probability the event occurs on the case day rather than the control days.  The advantage of case crossover models is any risk factors which vary slowly or not at all, or are the same on the case and control days, are automatically adjusted for.  The challenge introduced by case crossover models is the likelihood depends on non-linear combinations of the latent variables. 


Estimating $\alpha$ is the main statistical challenge with the cGAIM, which @pierre2020aim 
accomplish with frequentist inference methods that use sequential quadratic programming.  We will develop a Bayesian methodology for inference with the cGAIM --- the bcGAIM --- which will fully quantify the uncertainty around $\alpha$ and propagate the uncertainty into inference on $s$.  While there is consistent evidence that air pollution increases daily incidence of adverse health outcomes, we expect that information contained in data on the effects of specific combinations of pollutants at different lags is weak.  The bcGAIM will identify both what we can and cannot infer from historical health and pollution data, a feature which will become increasingly important as the dimensionality of $\alpha$ and $Z_{it}$ increase.


## Outcomes and applications

This project brings together the methodological components of several interdisciplinary and collaborative research activities which the four investigators have been engaging in independently of each other.  

The primary driver of this research is the need for an improved air quality warning system, which Health Canada and the Institut national de santé publique du Québec have separately approached Drs Brown and Chebana (respectively) about.  Currently the Canadian AQHI is composed of relative risks estimated from cohort studies, and estimated risks for individual pollutants are summed to create a log-relative risk which is in turn converted to a 10-point scale.  This is likely to over-estimate risk,  @franklin2008impact found that the effect of ozone on non-accidental mortality was "substantially reduced" after adjusting for particle sulfate and @liu2019ambient found significant differences in the percentage change of all-cause mortality attributable to PM~2.5~ and PM~10~ after adjusting for NO~2~ or SO~2~. Furthermore, there is evidence that some health outcomes are nonlinearly related to pollution measurements [@feng2016impact].  Dr. Brown's group has developed a linear multi-pollutant case/crossover model [@guowen2020multi] whereas Dr. Chebana's has used a cGAIM with a frequentist time series model [@pierre2020aim].  The proposed bcGAIM is a natural extension of, and merging of, these two methods.  

A second driver of this project is the environmental epidemiology research undertaken by the investigators in collaboration with health science researchers.  The Centre for Global Health Research, where Dr. Brown is partly based, has history of producing papers on global mortality in high-impact journals.  The Million Deaths Study in India has 13 years worth of cause-specific mortality data geocoded to point locations and with smoking and diet information about the deceased and from healthy respondents.  Dr. Franklin has a number of highly cited papers on air quality and mortality in environmental health journals.  With our collaborators, including Prabhat Jha in Toronto and Daniel Rainham at Dalhousie, we will use bcGAIM to produce papers for the top-ranked medical journals.

The third motivation for this CRT is the surge in availability of daily mortality data brought on by the COID-19 pandemic.  
The relationship between daily COVID-19 deaths and air pollution levels has recently become an active area of research.  @wu2020exposure find that a 1 $\mu$g increase in long-term exposure to ambient PM~2.5~ increases the COVID-19 mortality rate by 15%.  We will relate COVID-19 incidence and mortality to air pollution in major urban centres worldwide, where possible focusing on deaths outside long-term care homes.  


A key reason the bcGAIM model is ideal for the above problems is it will produce parameters which are interpretable.  The $\alpha$ coefficients give the relative importance of each pollutant (at each lag), and $s(\cdot)$ is the relative risk from a basket of exposures.  Unsupervised methods such as principle components analysis and clustering can be difficult to interpret [@davalos2017current]. A popular nonparametric method is Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), which models an exposure-response surface via a kernel function [@bobb2015bayesian]. Using a hierarchical Bayesian variable selection method, it can select one pollutant from a group of correlated ones, and is interpreted by visualizing cross-sections of a potentially high-dimensional exposure-response surface. The bcGAIM will provide similar flexibility to the BKMR, while being able to meet the communication needs of inter-disciplinary research teams.

## Methods

The bcGAIM will make four methodological advancements for modeling  health effects of mixtures of exposures. These are:

1. develop bcGAIM, a Bayesian inference methodology for high dimensional cGAIM's in case-crossover models;
1. create an efficient, non-iterative computational algorithm for bcGAIM's based on Laplace approximations;
1. develop non-parametric forms of the dose-response effect which encourage or enforce monotonicity; and
1. engage in interdisciplinary and applied research projects with our subject-area collaborators.

### Model

A simple two-pollutant version of bcGAIM has been implemented by Dr. Brown's group (under contract from Health Canada) in the MCMC software Stan [@carpenter2017stan] with a Poisson response variable.  This will be extended to having an $\alpha$ which is 12- or 15-dimensional, with three pollutants (O~3~, PM~2.5~, and NO~2~) at time lags of up to five days.  Converting the Poisson likelihood to case-crossover, moving to a highly-parallelized cloud platform, and increasing the dimensionality will require only modest amount of additional coding, although the algorithm is unlikely to function properly without a substantial amount of modification and optimization.  This is because we expect that $\alpha$ will not always be well identified, and the results will be sensitive to parametrizations and prior distributions. 

The major task in this component of the research will be to find reparametrizations and multivariable prior distributions that enable prior elicitation from subject-area specialists.  We will adopt the penalized complexity prior framework of @simpson2017penalising, specifying a base model with some suitably chosen values $\alpha_0$ and deriving a prior for $\alpha$ which corresponds to an exponential prior on the KL distance between $s(\alpha Z)$ and $s(\alpha_0 Z)$.  Expert advice will be used to set $\alpha_0$ and the rate of the exponential prior.  One possible scenario would be to have $\alpha_0$ with an entry of $1$ for PM~2.5~ at lag 1 and zero otherwise, and an extremely strong exponential prior on the KL distance.  This prior would encourage a conventional single-pollutant single-lag model, other pollutants would be inferred to have negligible effect on health outcomes unless the data provided considerable information to the contrary.  A weaker prior with $\alpha_0$ having multiple non-zero entries would allow for stronger multi-pollutant effects.   Box constraints, such as the entries of $\alpha$ being positive, should be relatively simple to implement.

Anticipating that the posterior of $\alpha$ will often have flat ridges, interpreted as overall pollution is known to be harmful but specific components may or may not be, communicating results to health scientists will be challenging.  Finding intuitive and interpretable low-dimensional functions of $\alpha$ which convey the 'known' and 'unknown' components of the results will be a second important task in this objective.



### Computation

For the second methodological aim, we will develop non-MCMC inference methods similar in spirit to INLA [@rue2009approximate]. The Latent Gaussian approximation in INLA separates the parameter space into covariance parameters $\theta$ and linear predictors $\eta = (\beta, \theta, f)$, and considers $\pi( \eta | Y, \theta)$, $\pi( \theta | Y)$, and $\pi(\eta | Y) = \int \pi(\eta | Y, \theta) \pi(\theta | Y) d\theta$ (the last one numerically). INLA performs approximate inference on $\theta$ by estimating $\phi( \theta | Y, \phi )$ with a normal distribution with mean $\theta^{*}$ and variance $\Sigma^{*}$. If the likelihood is log-concave and Gaussian priors are used, $\pi( \theta | Y, \phi )$ is unimodal and is well-approximated by the Laplace approximation. In @margossian2020hamiltonian, the authors estimate $\pi( \theta | Y, \phi)$ with the Laplace approximation and $\pi( \theta | T)$ with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. They find that this performs well for their examples, both of which have log-concave likelihoods.

Let us translate this reasoning to the bcGAIM, which has link function $g(\lambda_{t}) = X^{t}\beta + s( \alpha^{T} Z_{t}) + f_{1}(W_{1,t}) + \ldots + f_{K}(W_{K,t})$. Note that conditional on $\alpha$, $\alpha^{T}Z_{t}$ is known. Thus, we can simplify the estimation problem by considering parameters $\phi$, $\theta$, and $\alpha$ and estimating $\pi( \eta | Y, \theta, \alpha)$, $\pi( \alpha | Y, \theta )$, $\pi(\theta | Y)$, and $\pi(\eta | Y) = \int \pi(\eta | Y, \theta, \alpha) \pi( \alpha | Y, \theta ) \pi( \theta | Y) d\theta d\alpha$ (the last one numerically). The first and third densities in the integrand, $\pi(\eta | Y, \theta, \alpha)$ and $\pi( \theta | Y)$ are well-suited to the Laplace approximation while $\pi(\alpha | Y,\theta )$ can be estimated using HMC. Introducing two Laplace approximations will lessen the computational burden, and enable us to fit a hierarchical bcGAIM model to air pollution data. This will allow us to produce national estimates of air quality while fitting the bcGAIM to over 25 regions across Canada, each with over 6,000 daily observations, an otherwise daunting computational task. Therefore, this non-MCMC inference method will provide significant computational and ease-of-use benefits, and will expand the types of problems and number of users who can use the bcGAIM methodology. To facilitate use by other researchers, all bcGAIM software will be released in an R package.




### Monotonicity

The third methodological aim will consider ways of encouraging (or forcing) the relative risk function $s(\cdot)$ to be monotonic.  Monotonicity for non-parametric smoothing was formalized by @ramsay1998, and an early example of monotonic additive index models is @xia2006cumulative.   The cGAIM from @pierre2020aim allows for any linear constraint on $\alpha$ and different shape constraints on $s$ including monotonicity, convexity, and concavity. For frequentist inference monotonicity can be incorporated as a restriction of the parameter space during optimization, whereas Bayesian inference involves integrating out all possible realizations of $s$ (not only the mode).  Put differently, @golchi2015monotone state "While a rich literature exists on monotone function estimation, interpolation of monotone functions with uncertainty quantification remains an understudied topic." For this reason much of the previous literature on additive index models is not relevant to the development of bcGAIM.  

Initially we will consider different Gaussian processes for $s$ which are more likely to be monotonic than random walks, such as a first-order random walk plus drift.  Reparametrizations of higher-order random walks with suitably chosen priors for the boundary values (i.e. first and last point for RW2's) could also produce random functions with a low probability of having local optima.  A more sophisticated approach is offered by @golchi2015monotone, where sequential constrained Monte Carlo is used to take posterior samples from a process with positivity constraints on the derivatives.

Finally, consider an approach similar in spirit to bcGAIM. @burkner2020modelling propose a Bayesian model to estimate ordinal predictors with monotonic effects. They employ a simplex parameter $\zeta$ to model normalized differences between categories, and a scale parameter $b$. The prior on $b$ expresses prior knowledge on the average differences between adjacent categories, while the prior on $\zeta$ expresses prior knowledge on individual differences between adjacent categories. The authors suggest an $N(0,\sigma)$ prior on $b$ and a $\text{Dirichlet}(\alpha)$ prior on $\zeta$. Then, $\sigma$ and $\alpha$ would express how heavily average and individual differences between adjacent categories are penalized. Not only are $\zeta$ and $b$ interpretable, but so are the prior parameters $\sigma$ and $\alpha$. The bcGAIM seeks to achieve this ease of interpretation of its parameters and priors. This will encourage adoption of the bcGAIM in other research areas, which is one of the goals of this project.



### Applications

In a highly cited paper with many eminent co-authors, @liu2019ambient estimate short-term effects of PM~2.5~ on mortality in 652 cities and produce a pooled global estimate.  All-cause mortality risk is shown to be roughly 4% higher at $100\mu g/m^3$ than at $5\mu g/m^3$, with the curve steeper at low values than higher values.  A Poisson time series model with regression splines is used. We will reproduce this analysis in as many cities as possible using bcGAIM, improving on @liu2019ambient by using case-crossover models, monotonic semi-parametric models, and accounting for the combined effects of multiple pollutants.  

COVID-19 incidence and mortality counts have been made publicly available for many countries, much of the data is available sub-nationally, with age and sex information, and for individuals in and outside of nursing homes.  While incidence data is both incomplete and with a level of completeness varying spatio-temporally, better measures of incidence will become available from antibody studies.  The Centre for Global Health Research runs the Action to Beat Coronavirus study ( [abcstudy.ca](http://abcstudy.ca) ), which started collecting blood samples from a representative sample of the Canadian population in May 2020.  As of October, 8000 samples have been returned and a second round of testing is underway.  With repeated samples an estimate of true incidence over time can be obtained and changes in under-reporting inferred.  We will use bcGAIM to quantify the effect of air quality on COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and the case fatality rate.
