**Overview**

The health effects associated with exposure to ambient air pollution have been shown to be differential depending on the composition of pollutants in the air [@dominici2010protecting]. As such, in the environmental health community there is growing interest in developing a simple, intuitive air quality index that simultaneously combines multiple air pollutants with which health effects can be assessed [@dominici2010protecting; @stieb2008new; @bopp2018something]. An air quality index that reflects multiple pollutants simultaneously can better capture the true exposure of the air breathe. In this proposal, we will improve statistical methods for generating a combined exposure metric within a an epidemiological framework whereby we can conduct inference on the health effects associated with exposure to multiple air pollutants simultaneously. We will focus on models that assess the short-term association between air pollutants and health outcomes. 

The *constrained groupwise additive index model* (cGAIM) was introduced by @pierre2020aim, and provides a frequentist inference method for additive models using sequential quadratic programming. For a response distribution $D$, parameter $\theta = (\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{d})$, link function $g$, and constraints as below, the cGAIM is,

\vspace{-0.75em}
$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \lambda_{t} & \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}  D( \lambda_{t}, \tau ) \\
  g( \lambda_{t} ) &= X_t\beta + s(\alpha^{T} Z_t ) + f_{1}( W_{1t} ) + \ldots + f_{K}( W_{Kt} ).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here $Y_{t}$ is the outcome of interest, $\beta$ is the vector of regression coefficients for linear covariates $X_t$, and $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{K}$ are smoothing functions that account for potential confounding variables $W_{kt}$. The distinguishing feature of cGAIM lies in $s$, a smooth function fit to a linear combination of environmental covariates $Z_t$. The $\alpha$ is a vector of weights on the entries of $Z_t$, giving the relative contribution of each component of $Z_t$. The smooth function $s$ is modelled with a flexible parametric family such as cubic splines or a random walk. Estimating $\alpha$, or more specifically finding the set of plausible values for $\alpha$, is the main challenge of working with cGAIM.

We propose to develop a Bayesian methodology for inference with the cGAIM -- the bcGAIM. Compared to the cGAIM, the bcGAIM will provide two main statistical benefits. The first is quantification of the uncertainty for $\alpha$; the cGAIM does not provide confidence intervals for $\alpha$. Given that pollutants tend to be positively correlated, it is possible that $\alpha$ is not well identified and all reasonable measures of air quality are equally predictive of health outcomes. It is also possible that the posterior distribution of $\alpha$ is narrow and the importance of, say, nitrous oxide relative to ozone can be estimated with some certainty. Either result would be a significant contribution research on the health effects of multiple pollutants.  The second advantage is that the bcGAIM will be able to accommodate a higher-dimensional $\alpha$ than previously used, allowing $Z_t$ to not only contain multiple pollutants, but pollutant concentrations at different time lags. The joint posterior distributions of this high-dimensional $\alpha$ will therefore provide information on the relative contributions and time windows (lags) for which multiple air pollutants are associated with health outcomes.

We will also develop method for fitting case/crossover models using bcGAIM, which offers advantages over the more standard log-linear Poisson model.  The case crossover has seen increased attention in the air pollution literature [@wei2019short; @casecrossover]. It can be viewed as a proportional hazards survival model, where each individual is in a separate strata and 'control days' are chosen to have the same baseline hazard as the event day. Additional details are given in the Methods section below.


**Objectives**

This proposal has three main research objectives. The first is to develop an air quality index for Canadian cities that accounts for the combined effects of multiple air pollutants. This index will be developed in collaboration with Health Canada and INSQ with the intention of it being used in a public warning system. The second aim is to undertake epidemiological studies involving exposures to multiple environmental pollutants in the areas of the world where the Centre for Global Health Research has suitable data (Canada, India, USA). The third application is a specific application of the air quality index, namely investigating how exposure to different mixtures of pollutants is associated with daily COVID-19 mortality. 

There is evidence that the health effects estimated from single pollutant models may be in fact be caused by a correlated pollutant omitted from the model. For example, @franklin2008impact found that the effect of ozone on non-accidental mortality was "substantially reduced" after adjusting for particle sulfate and @liu2019ambient found significant differences in the percentage change of all-cause mortality attributable to PM~2.5~ and PM~10~ after adjusting for NO~2~ or SO~2~.  

Further, there is evidence that some health outcomes are nonlinearly related to health outcomes levels [@feng2016impact].  Achieving the three objectives requires a non-linear (or semi-parametric) dose-response curve and a combined-effect multi-pollutant exposure model.  Our bcGAIM model will meet the requirements necessary to fulfil these objectives due to its being able to estimate weights using data, allowing for nonlinear relationships between pollutants and health outcomes, and applicable to both Poisson time series and case-crossover models.

Interpretability of model outputs is another requirement of this project, and many 'unsupervised' methods (i.e. principle components analysis and clustering) are difficult to interpret [@davalos2017current]. A popular nonparametric method is the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), introduced in @bobb2015bayesian, which models an exposure-response surface via a kernel function. Using a hierarchical Bayesian variable selection method, it can select one pollutant from a group of correlated ones, and is interpreted by visualizing cross-sections of a potentially high-dimensional exposure-response surface.  The bcGAIM will provide some of the flexibility of BKMR and clustering while being sufficiently interpretable to meet the communication needs of an inter-disciplinary research team.

The relationship between daily COVID-19 deaths and air pollution levels has recently become an active area of research. For instance, @wu2020exposure apply a zero-inflated negative binomial to model U.S. data, where the zero-inflation accounts for counties with no COVID-19 deaths. They find that a 1 $\mu$g increase in long-term exposure to ambient PM~2.5~ increases the COVID-19 death rate by 15%.  We will use variations on bcGAIM to examine the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and combinations of air pollutants.  As well as exploring daily variations in the case fatality rate (and its relation to air quality), the model will be adapted to consider long-term exposures and COVID-19 incidence rates.  



**Methods**

The bcGAIM will make four methodological advancements for modeling the health effects of mixtures of pollutants.  These are:

  1. extending the cGAIM to higher dimensional problems;
  2. fully exploring the parameter space to identify all plausible values for $\alpha$;
  3. developing priors for shape-constrained Bayesian inference on the smooth function $s$; and
  4. using case crossover models in place of the Poisson response variable.
  
In @pierre2020aim, the cGAIM uses an iterative two-step optimization scheme -- $\alpha$ is updated using a quadratic program, then $s$ is updated using the shape-constrained additive model methodology of @pya2015shape. The bcGAIM will initially be implemented in Stan, a statistical modeling language that performs optimization using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [@carpenter2017stan]. The Stan modeling language makes it straightforward (in theory) to extend the bcGAIM to include additional pollutants, additional lags for pollutants in the model, and additional smooth functions $s$.  It is expected that the $\alpha$ parameters will not always be well identified, and results will be sensitive to model assumptions and prior distributions.  One task in this component of the research will be to find reparametrizations and multivariable prior distributions which enable prior elicitation from subject-area specialists.

Following its implementation in Stan, the bcGAIM will be implemented using non-MCMC inference methods, similar to Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) [@rue2009approximate].  One such algorithm for single-pollutant case-crossover models was recently developed by @casecrossover, and this approach will be extended to allow for inference on the $\alpha$ parameters in bcGAIM.  These non-MCMC methods provide significant computational and ease-of-use benefits, and will expand the types of problems and number of users who can use the bcGAIM methodology.  To facilitate use by other researchers, all bcGAIM software will be released in an R package.

After bcGAIM is implemented for a three-dimensional $\alpha$, more specifically ozone, fine particulates, and nitrous oxide at two day lags, additional time lags will be added with the resulting $\alpha$ being 9- or 12 dimensional.  The computational and methodological challenges at this stage are expected to be significant, and parallelizing the algorithm on cloud platforms will be used to dramatically increase the number of candidate values of $\alpha$ considered.

Another major task in developing the bcGAIM is in developing random effect distributions for shape-constrained Bayesian inference on $s$. In addition to having desirable statistical properties, the chosen models should be simple and interpretable so that it can be elicited from non-statistical experts. This is difficult to achieve for shape constraints. The first reason for this is that $s$ may not have any parameters related to the desired constraint; for example, a 1^st^-order random walk has no parameters related to monotonicity. To overcome this, $s$ could be re-parameterized, the functional form of $s$ could be exploited, or data augmentation schemes that introduce derivative observations could be used [@riihimaki2010gaussian]. The second reason is that substantial mathematical analysis is required to ensure priors do not introduce unwanted behavior. For example, a truncated multivariate normal (tMVN) prior can induce monotonicity when placed on the coefficients $\beta^{'}$ of a finite basis expansion of $s$ [@maatouk2017gaussian]. However, the tMVN prior places negligible mass on near-flat regions of $s$. While @zhou2020truncated remedy this by introducing a scale parameter to the coordinates of the tMVN distribution, the modified tMVN prior is placed on $\beta^{'}$, not $s$. In comparison to the tMVN prior, we seek a prior on $s$ and not its basis expansion. Such a prior will be less encumbered by mathematical details and more easily understood by non-statistical experts. This ease of interpretation should encourage adoption of the bcGAIM among non-statistical experts, which is one of the goals of this project.

**Anticipated roles of trainees (students and post-doctoral fellows)**

<!-- Limit to 1/2 page. Full details will be included in the full proposal --> 

Kamal Rai will complete his PhD in 2021 and will work on this project as a postdoc.  He will develop the Bayesian implementation of the GAIM models in Stan. This includes exploring determining appropriate prior distributions for the weights $\alpha$, developing visualizations that communicate modeling results, and assisting other project members in developing shape constraints. He will be responsible for producing paper(s) summarizing the results of this model when run on Canadian air pollution and mortality data. To facilitate team communication and cohesion, he will also split time between Toronto (at the Centre for Global Health Research) and Ottawa (at the University of Ottawa), and use the proximity of the University of Ottawa to Quebec to occasionally visit project collaborators located there.

The University of Toronto PhD student will develop the INLA-like Bayesian computations to conduct inference on the GAIM, and compare its results from those obtained from the Stan implementation. A University of Laval or University of Ottawa PhD student will develop methods to conduct shape-constrained (Bayesian) inference, and examine the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and air pollution levels.
