With this letter of support for the Collaborative Research Team proposal on
"Statistical Methods for Daily Mortality and Multiple Environmental Risk Factors", I would like to express my enthusiasm for this project and its potential for having a substantial impact on global mortality research.  At CGHR we regard ourselves as one of the primary quantitative global health research groups, having more publications in high-impact journals than any other comparable group in Canada.  I look forward to collaborating with this group to create publications in the highest tier of medical journals.

Hana Fu is a research associate based here who has been working with the air quality and mortality data from Health Canada, as well as working with the daily mortality data from the Million Deaths Study.  She can continue to lead the data management work for these projects up to one day per week, which is an in-kind contribution from CGHR in excess of $10,000 annually.  


Regards,


Prabhat Jha
