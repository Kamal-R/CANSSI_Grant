### The Model

We propose to develop a statistical methodology for modeling the *combined effect* of multiple covariates with non-linear relationships to the outcome of interest. For a response distribution $D$ from the exponential family with a d-dimensional parameter $\theta = (\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{d})$ and invertible (canonical) link function $g$, the general form of the proposed model is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \theta_{t} &= D( \theta ), \\
  g( \theta ) &= X\beta + 
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^{I} s_{i}(\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \ldots + \alpha_{n_{i}}\gamma_{n_{i}})+ 
        \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}( \eta_{k,*} )
\end{aligned}
$$
In the above, $X$ is a regression matrix and $\beta$ a vector of fixed effects. The second sum consists of $K$ smoothing functions $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{K}$ applied to $K$ potential confounders $\eta_{k,*}$ (where $*$ indexes possible values of $\eta_{k,*}$). Our interest lies in the first sum, which fits smooth functions to convex combinations of covariates. This is a flexible and extensible model that allows for nonlinear interactions between an outcome of interest $Y_{t}$ and covariates $(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n_{i}})_{i=1}^{I}$ via smoothing functions $\{ f_{i} \}$. 

To explore the flexibility of this model, we compare it to a standard regression model and one with a more general functional specification of $s_{i}$. To ease the notation in the notation, let us assume there are no confounders and that are only considering a convex combination of two covariates $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$. Then, there three models we are considering have link function,
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{ 1. } g( \theta ) &= X\beta + \alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2} & \text{ Standard link function  } \\
  \text{ 2. } g( \theta ) &= X\beta + s_{1}(\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2}) & \text{ Proposed link function } \\
  \text{ 3. } g( \theta ) &= X\beta + s_{1}^{*}(\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}) & \text{ 2D link function } \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, it easy to see that the complexity of the second model, proposed in this paper, is between that of a standard regression model and one that uses a 2-dimensional smoother. The proposed model fits a convex combination of $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ using a 1-dimensional smoothing function, which has two major advantages over using a 2-dimensional smoother. It's first advantage is that it is less computationally demanding, as it does *not* suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The convex combination $\alpha_{1}\gamma_{1} + \alpha_{2}\gamma_{2}$ is always 1-dimensional, and remains so regardless of how many terms are the sum. This constrasts to $s^{*}_{1}$, whose dimensionality scales with its number of inputs. It's second advantage is that it is more interpretable. The *weights* $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ reflect the relative contribution of $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ (respectively) and are thus readily interpretable. In comparison, $s^{*}(\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2})$ has no such weights and is perhaps best interpreted via (two-dimensional) visualizations.

We propose to develop a fully Bayesian implementation of this model using Stan, a widely used software package that allows for rapid iteration and development of Bayesian models. As Bayesians, we will use random walks as our smoothing function; their equivalent to smoothing splines is detailed in [@, @].

**ADD**: Non-MCMC implementations?  


## Research Questions

### Overview

Recent years have seen an increased interest in modeling the joint effect of two or more pollutants in health outcomes [@dominici2010protecting; @billionnet2012estimating; @davalos2017current]; Bayesian approaches can be seen in [@blangiardo2019hierarchical; @bobb2013reduced; @huang2018multivariate]. 
  
  1. What is the combined effect of multiple pollutants on various daily mortality outcomes? 
  2. What is the relationship between daily COVID-19 mortality and air pollution? 
  
  
### Research Question #1

The workhorse of the air pollution literature is the one-pollutant Poisson regression model that accounts for confounders using fixed effects and smooth functions, typically a natural cubic splines [@samet2000fine; @dominici2002use; @laden2006reduction]. Let the *average* $\lambda_{t}$. Then, a typical model is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \lambda_{t} &= \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{t}), \\
  \log(\lambda_{t}) &= X\beta + \gamma_{1} P_{1,t} + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}(\eta_{k,*}).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $Y_{t}$ is the health outcome of interest, such as respiratory mortality or morbidity. The design matrix $X$ typically contains day-of-the-week effects and seasonal terms, and the $f_{i}(\eta_{k,*})$ are smooth functions of potential confounders such as time and temperature. A more flexible version of this model is to fit $P_{1,t}$ to its own smooth function $s_{i}$. More generally, we could fit $N$ pollutants using smooth functions. A third alternative is to model multiple pollutants by applying smooth functions to linear combinations of pollutants. 

These are same three scenarios as considered above. *Why move beyond the linear model*?

Using linear combinations of pollutants will allow the model to estimate their *combined* effect in a natural and informative way. For instance, this weighted sum naturally captures synergistic effects that can occurs when more than one pollutant is present at higher levels [@xia2006cumulative]. The levels of different pollutants are also highly correlated (**ADD**: Reference); modeling sums as nonlinear functions will help alleviate the statistical concerns introduced by this high correlation (**ADD**: Reference).

<!--
(**ADD**: Better transition). When fit to Canadian mortality data, the log relative risks estimated by the one-pollutant model are very small for PM~2.5~, PM~10~, SO~2~, and NO~2~ [@guowen2020multi]. Additionally, the association between the chosen health outcome and $P_{1}$ may not be (log) linear, with higher pollutant levels having larger health impacts [@liu2019ambient]. 
-->

### Comparisons to other Multi-Pollutant Models 

Recent years have seen more interest in modeling the health impact of multiple pollutants. The review article by @davalos2017current identified various statistical approaches used to accounting for multiple pollutants: additive main effects, effect measure modification, dimension reduction, and nonparametric methods. Additive main effects models are difficult to extend to multiple pollutants [@dominici2010protecting], while nonparameteric methods are generally less interpretable than parametric ones. A principle goal of air pollution modeling is to build evidence regarding levels that cause health effects. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of the research teams and potential stakeholders regarding this research, the models *must* be easily interpetable to meet this goal. 

A number of dimension reduction methods are identified in @davalos2017current. Unsupervised methods include principle components analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering. Unfortunately, the coefficients obtained from using PCA are often difficult to interpret, and clustering is also difficult to interpret. Some papers using supervised methods consider weighted sums of pollutant concentrations. The authors of @pachon2012development specify the weights from data rather than estimating them, while the authors of @roberts2006investigating consider model a *mixture* of pollutants linearly; this corresponds to assuming that $s_{1}(\alpha_{1}P_{1,t} + \alpha_{2}P_{2,t}) = \beta_{m}(\alpha_{1}P_{1,t} + \alpha_{2}P_{2,t})$ is a linear function. 

In @sun2013statistical, the authors make quantitative comparisons of five different methods. These include 


## Research Question #2

The relationship between daily coronavirus deaths and air pollution levels has become an active area of research in recent months. For instance, @wu2020exposure finds that a 1 $\mu$g increase in long-term exposure to ambient PM~2.5~ increases the coronavirus death rate by 15%. Additional studies that examine this relationship include [@conticini2020can; @sciomer2020sars; @setti2020searching]. 

However, much work remains to be done. For instance, non-COVID-19 daily mortality data is generally not yet available, such that we do not have an accurate meaasure of *excess* deaths attributable to COVID-19. These excess deaths could be attributable to under-reported COVID-19 case and death counts (due to limited testing), restricted access to care for patients with other health conditions, or potential reporting delays. Moreover, cumulative COVID-19 mortality will likely continue to rise for some time, making the question of excess deaths due to COVID-19 best suited for an ongoing inquiry that help inform public health responses.

### Anticipated roles of trainees (students and post-doctoral fellows)

<!-- Limit to 1/2 page. Full details will be included in the full proposal --> 

Kamal will develop the Bayesian implementation of the multiple pollutant models in Stan. This includes exploring determining appropriate prior distributions for the weights $\alpha$ and developing visualizations that communicate model results in a simple and interpretable way. He will be responsible for producing paper(s) summarizing the results of this model when run on Canadian air pollution and mortality data. To facilitate team communication and cohesion, he will also split time between Toronto (at the Centre for Global Health Research) and Ottawa (at the Universtiy of Ottawa), and use the proximity to Quebec to visit the collaborators there.  

The University of Toronto PhD student will compare the results from the Bayesian random walk models to those obtained from non-MCMC methods. For example, these could include frequentist methods that fit (natural cubic) splines or Bayesian inference using R-INLA [@rue2009approximate]. The University of Laval/University of Ottawa PhD student will compare the results from the Stan implementation to those obtained by a case-crossover model.
