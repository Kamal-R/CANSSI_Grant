### Research Aims

<!-- Limit to 5 pages, including references (include all details). Will be expanded to 7 pages in the full proposal -->



This project aims to investigate the combined effect of multiple pollutants on various mortality outcomes by examining two main research questions.
  
  1. What is the combined effect of multiple pollutants on various daily mortality outcomes? 
  2. What is the relationship between daily nCovid-19 mortality and air pollution? 
  
Let us consider the first research question. The workhorse of the air pollution literature is a one-pollutant Poisson regression model that accounts for confounders using fixed effects and smooth functions, typically a natural cubic splines [@samet2000fine; @dominici2002use; @laden2006reduction]. A typical model is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y_{t} | \lambda_{t} &= \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{t}), \\
  \log(\lambda_{t}) &= X\beta + \gamma P_{1} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{I} f_{i}(t_{i}).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $Y_{t}$ is the health outcome of interest, such as respiratory mortality or morbidity. The design matrix $X$ typically contains day-of-the-week effects and seasonal terms, and the $f_{i}(t_{i})$ are smooth functions of potential confounders such as time and temperature. When fit to Canadian mortality data, the log relative risks estimated by the one-pollutant model are very small for PM~2.5~, PM~10~, SO~2~, and NO~2~ [@guowen2020multi]. Additionally, the association between the chosen health outcome and $P_{1}$ may not be (log) linear, with higher pollutant levels having larger health impacts [@liu2019ambient].

Modeling $P_{1}$ through a nonlinear but smooth function $s_{1}$ is one potential remedy to the second concern. A natural extension of this model to $N$ pollutants is to fit each pollutant $P_{i}$ to its own smooth function $s_{i}$ ($i = 1,\ldots,N)$. Then, the link function in the model becomes, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \log(\lambda_{t}) &= X\beta + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}(P_{i}) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{I} f_{i}(t_{i}).
\end{aligned}
$$
While promising, this version of the multiple-pollutant model raises the concern that the the correlation between pollutants may bias estimates, which is particularly meaningful when (log) estimates are so small. Taking inspiration from *additive index models*, discussed in @fawzi2016structured, this project will apply smooth functions to a convex combination of pollutants. This will allow the model to estimate the *combined* effect of these polluntants in a natural and informative way. For instance, this weighted sum naturally captures synergistic effects that can occurs when more than one pollutant is present at higher levels [@xia2006cumulative]. 

Let $f_{i}$ ($i=1,\ldots,I$) denote smooth functions of confounders and $s_{1}$ a smooth function of pollutants $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Thus, the link function in our proposed model is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \log(\lambda_{t}) &= X\beta + s_{1}(\alpha_{1}P_{1} + \alpha_{2}P_{2}) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{I} f_{i}(t_{i}).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ are weights that will be estimated by the model. They can be interpreted as the relative impact that each pollutant on the chosen mortality outcome. 

The second research question considers the mortality outcome of daily coronavirus deaths. This has become an active area of research in recent months. For instance, @wu2020exposure finds that a 1 $\mu$g increase in  long-term exposure to ambient PM~2.5~ increases the coronavirus death rate by 15%. Additional studies that examine this relationship include [@conticini2020can; @sciomer2020sars; @setti2020searching]. 

Much work remains to be done. For instance, non-COVID-19 daily mortality data is generally not available, such that these early results are unable to obtain an accurate measure of the *excess* deaths attributable to COVID-19. This is a very important point, as COVID-19 cases (and deaths) are likely under-reported due to limited levels of testing. For another, cumulative COVID-19 mortality will continue to rise for some time, such that this question is most suitable for ongoing inquiry over the next 2-3 years.
